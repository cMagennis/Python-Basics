# Python-Basics

Hey! If you're just skimming through to check out programs or perhaps have a quick look at my portfolio then here is a helpful list of the "actual" programs I made during this course:



And here is the full transcript and description of the course:

My first crash course in Python and all assigned projects. My intention with this is create a base level portfolio of some basic python functions. These were created by following various Youtube tutorials. Once this is complete I can move on to more advanced tools where I will put several Python books I have purchased to use. See: Python-Lower-Intermediate


Hello_world: A simple lesson in print and console function. I also used this opportunity to refresh my Git knowledge and a bit of version control.


Variables: A quick lesson in variables. Strings, numbers & boolean. How to combine variables with printed text in order to efficiently alter information. 


Working_with_strings: Some basic string functionality. Also our first use of functions and use of index. A lot of the standard tools covered. Here's a list: .tolower() .tolower() .index("") .replace(" , ")


Working_with_numbers: Starting off with basic arithmatic operators, then some basic functions we can use with numbers. Ending with importing the Math module in order to use a few expanded functions that aren't available normally. 


User_input: Very basic way of gathering user input. Not yet attached to a site or text box etc. Also we assign the info to variables and then use those variables to print the info for the user. 

The_begginings_of_a_basic_calculator: Forgive the ridiculously long name, I just wanted to clarify that this isn't really a calculator. However we see the start of one here. I used some basic operators (just addition so far) and a few key functions. Starting to see how much functions are used. So we have int(), float() and str(). Main take away: Python defaults user input to a string.
